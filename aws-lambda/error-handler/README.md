# error-handler

The AWS Lambda function in the error-handler folder deals with any error conditions generated by the Lambda functions described above for alarm frame processing.

## Contents

1. **index.js** - source code.

## How to use

### IAM Role

Using the [AWS IAM Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) create an IAM Role containing the "AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" permission.

### Upload to AWS

Using the [AWS Lambda Console](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda), create a new Lambda Function called *s3-archive-image* and copy the code from index.js directly into the inline code editor.

Ensure that the function uses your newly created IAM Role.

Tip: Use the "blank function" blueprint and skip the "configure triggers" prompt when creating the function.
